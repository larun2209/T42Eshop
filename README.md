## What does this come with?

This is a fully working react-native app with a [Hasura](https://hasura.io) backend. 

- There are two tables (product and cart) in the database populated with some data.
- We make data API calls to get the list of products per their category.The functions that make these calls are in the `react-native/src/hasuraApi.js` file. 
-There is a search option to serach for product in the database
- Selecting an item from the list of products will add to cart.This is only partially functional!
- When "my oder' is accessed,there is a login screen in this app where the authentication is managed by the Hasura Auth APIs.
